# Book Finder App

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

Create an application that will allow users to search for books by entering a query (Title, Author, etc). Display the resulting books in a list on the page with all the corresponding data.

## User Stories

-   [ ] User can enter a search query into an `input` field
-   [ ] User can submit the query. This will call an API that will return an array of books with the corresponding data (**Title**, **Author**, **Published Date**, **Picture**, etc)
-   [ ] User can see the list of books appearing on the page

## Bonus features

-   [ ] For each item in the list add a link that will send the User to an external site which has more information about the book
-   [ ] Implement a Responsive Design
-   [ ] Add loading animations
